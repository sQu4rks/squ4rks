<h2 align="center">👋 Hi there! I am squ4rks but most people call me Marcel</h2>
<h4 align="center">Solutions Architect</h4>

Marcel started to write code at the tender age of ten after stumbling over a book on Delphi for Kids. Once that computer screen showed the text he typed in the editor, a new hobby was found. A computer science degree, a few open source and freelance projects as well as internships later and Marcel is now a Solutions Architect. 

I am the Author of [Python Network Programming Techniques](https://www.packtpub.com/product/python-network-programming-techniques/9781838646639) (ISBN 978-1-83864-663-9) and also occasionally speak at conferences. You can have a look at some of my talks [here](https://marcel.nlogn.org/category/talks.html).

Besides writing about himself in third person and outside of work he has a passion for 🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️🗻⌚️🍣 in no particular order.
